# Shopping Cart! :credit_card::money_with_wings:

Hey there!

In this project, i was able to:

<ul> 
  <li>Make API (Application Programming Interface) requests;</li>
  <li>Manipulating DOM;</li>
  <li>Manipulating HTML;</li>
  <li>Manipulating JavaScript;</li>
  <li>Manipulating CSS;</li>
  <li>Work with ASYNC Functions!</li>
</ul>

The Shopping Cart is totally dinamic and consumes all the data straight from the Mercado Livre's:tm: API!
Let me know what you think about it!

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹
